description: Prepare PROGRESS.md for next session — save full state and stop
allowed-tools: Read, Edit, Write, Bash(git*)

Update PROGRESS.md with:
1. Current sprint status (executing/blocked/complete)
2. Which tasks are done (checkboxes)
3. "Next actions" = exactly ONE concrete next step
4. Any new blockers or decisions made this session

Then commit and push: "handoff: save session state"

This ensures the next Claude Code session can pick up exactly where we left off.
